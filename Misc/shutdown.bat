# its pretty easy to understand with this bat file you can just shutdown
# the /s stands for shutdown
# the /t stands for time but in seconds counted
# for example if you want to restart your pc you will just type: shutdown.exe /r /t 120
# there more commands but this are the basics of it :)
# also to cancel the reboot or shutdown just type: shutdown.exe /a
shutdown.exe /s /t 120
