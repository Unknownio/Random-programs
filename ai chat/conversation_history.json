In summer it can reach the low‑30s °C (mid‑80s °F), while winter nights often drop below freezing.\n\nIf you’d like a more specific snapshot—say for tomorrow’s evening or a particular date—just let me know the time frame, and I’ll walk you through how to find that info."

      "content": "I don’t have live data or a built‑in forecast engine, so I can’t give you an exact temperature or precipitation chance for tomorrow in Skopje. However, here’s how you can quickly find the most reliable information:\n\n| Step | What to Do | Why it Works |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| 1 | Open a weather website or app (e.g., <https://www.accuweather.com/en/ma/skopje/32255/weather-forecast/32255>, <https://www.weather.com/>). | These sites pull data directly from the Macedonian Meteorological Service and other sources. |\n| 2 | Enter “Skopje” in the search bar, or use your device’s location services. | The forecast will be tailored to Skopje’s coordinates (approx. 42.0156° N, 21.4254° E). |\n| 3 | Look at the “Tomorrow” tab or the 24‑hour timeline. | You’ll see a graph of expected highs/lows, precipitation probability, wind speed, and humidity. |\n| 4 | Check for any weather alerts. | Skopje can experience sudden thunderstorms in spring or early autumn—alerts let you stay prepared. |\n\n**Typical pattern (historical context)**  \n- **Late April/early May**: Average highs around 20–25 °C (68–77 °F), lows near 10–12 °C (50–54 °F). Chance of rain is usually low but can spike if a frontal system moves in.  \n- **If you’re planning an outdoor activity**, it’s wise to carry a light jacket and an umbrella just in case.\n\n**Quick tip for offline access:** If you’re traveling or need the forecast without internet, most mobile carriers offer a “weather text” service where you can text a keyword (e.g., “SKOPJE”) to a number and receive a brief summary. Check with your provider for details.\n\nLet me know if you’d like help interpreting any of those numbers or planning around specific weather conditions!"
